     * Exports a value as a string
     *
     * The output of this method is similar to the output of print_r(), but
     * improved in various aspects:
     *
     *  - NULL is rendered as "null" (instead of "")
     *  - TRUE is rendered as "true" (instead of "1")
     *  - FALSE is rendered as "false" (instead of "")
     *  - Strings are always quoted with single quotes
     *  - Carriage returns and newlines are normalized to \n
     *  - Recursion and repeated rendering is treated properly
