        (4)   (Line Breaks) A line break in a text body, represented
                    as a CRLF sequence in the text canonical form, must be
                    represented by a (RFC 822) line break, which is also a
                    CRLF sequence, in the Quoted-Printable encoding.  Since
                    the canonical representation of media types other than
                    text do not generally include the representation of
                    line breaks as CRLF sequences, no hard line breaks
                    (i.e. line breaks that are intended to be meaningful
                    and to be displayed to the user) can occur in the
                    quoted-printable encoding of such types.  Sequences
                    like "=0D", "=0A", "=0A=0D" and "=0D=0A" will routinely
                    appear in non-text data represented in quoted-
                    printable, of course.

                    Note that many implementations may elect to encode the
                    local representation of various content types directly
                    rather than converting to canonical form first,
                    encoding, and then converting back to local
                    representation.  In particular, this may
