xpression followed by a switch statement to match dynamic routes.

     * The regular expression matches both the host and the pathinfo at the same time. For stellar performance,
     * it is built as a tree of patterns, with re-ordering logic to group same-prefix routes together when possible.
     *
     * Patterns are named so that we know which one matched (https://pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2syntax.html#SEC23).
     * This name is used to "switch" to the additional logic required to match the final route.
     *
     * Condition-less paths are put in a static array in the switch's default, with generic matching logic.
     * Paths that can match two or more routes, or have user-specified conditions are put in separate switch's cases.
