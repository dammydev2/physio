/**
 * A singleton mime type guesser.
 *
 * By default, all mime type guessers provided by the framework are installed
 * (if available on the current OS/PHP setup).
 *
 * You can register custom guessers by calling the register() method on the
 * singleton instance. Custom guessers are always called before any default ones.
 *
 *     $guesser = MimeTypeGuesser::getInstance();
 *     $guesser->register(new MyCustomMimeTypeGuesser());
 *
 * If you want to change the order of the default guessers, just re-register your
 * preferred one as a custom one. The last registered guesser is preferred over
 * previously
