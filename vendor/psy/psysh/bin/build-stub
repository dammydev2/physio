/**
 * Provide implicit namespaces for subsequent execution.
 *
 * The namespace pass remembers the last standalone namespace line encountered:
 *
 *     namespace Foo\Bar;
 *
 * ... which it then applies implicitly to all future evaluated code, until the
 * namespace is replaced by another namespace. To reset to the top level
 * namespace, enter `namespace {}`. This is a bit ugly, but it does the trick :)
