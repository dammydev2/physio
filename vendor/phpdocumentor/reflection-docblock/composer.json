 * Convenience class to create a Context for DocBlocks when not using the Reflection Component of phpDocumentor.

 * For a DocBlock to be able to resolve types that use partial namespace names or rely on namespace imports we need to
 * provide a bit of context so that the DocBlock can read that and based on it decide how to resolve the types to
 * Fully Qualified names.
