Complex Argument Matching With Mockery::on
==========================================

When we need to do a more complex argument matching for an expected method call,
the ``\Mockery::on()`` matcher comes in really handy. It accepts a closure as an
argument and that closure in turn receives the argument passed in to the method,
when called. If the closure returns ``true``, Mockery will consider that the
